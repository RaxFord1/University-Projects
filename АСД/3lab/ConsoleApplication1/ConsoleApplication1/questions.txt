ARCHIDAMUS
Would they else be content to die?
LEONTES
Tongue-tied, our queen? You'll stay?
HERMIONE
Nay, but you will? Will you go yet? How say you?
My prisoner? or my guest? Come, I'll question you
Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
You were pretty lordings then?
HERMIONE
Was not my lord
The verier wag o' the two?
LEONTES
Is he won yet?
HERMIONE
Never? have I twice said well? when was't before? But to the goal:
My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
What was my first?
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when? Mamillius,
Art thou my boy? What, hast
smutch'd thy nose?
Art thou my calf? Can thy dam?--may't be? thy intention stabs the centre:
Thou dost make possible things not so held,
Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?
POLIXENES
What means Sicilia?
What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?
HERMIONE
You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
Are you moved, my lord? Mine honest friend,
Will you take eggs for money? My brother,
Are you so fond of your young prince as we
Do seem to be of ours?
HERMIONE
If you would seek us,
We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there? What, Camillo there?
LEONTES
Didst note it?
LEONTES
Didst perceive it? How came't, Camillo,
That he did stay? Was this taken
By any understanding pate but thine?
For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,
But of the finer natures? by some severals
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
Perchance are to this business purblind?
LEONTES
Ay, but why?
LEONTES
Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
For to a vision so apparent rumour
Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
Resides not in that man that does not think,--
My wife is slippery?
LEONTES
Is whispering nothing?
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible
Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
CAMILLO
Who does infect her?
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,
Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
Could man so blench? But, for me,
What case stand I in? Not speak?
POLIXENES
What is the news i' the court? Do you know, and dare not?
POLIXENES
By whom, Camillo?
POLIXENES
For what?
POLIXENES
How should this grow?
First Lady
Come, my gracious lord,
Shall I be your playfellow?
First Lady
Why, my sweet lord?
Second Lady
And why so, my lord?
Second Lady
Who taught you this? Pray now
What colour are your eyebrows?
HERMIONE
What wisdom stirs amongst you?
MAMILLIUS
Merry or sad shall't be?
Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others

LEONTES
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him? How came the posterns
So easily open?
HERMIONE
What is this? sport?
LEONTES
Shall I be heard?
HERMIONE
Who is't that goes with me? lack I credit?
LEONTES
Why, what need we
Commune with you of this, but rather follow
Our forceful instigation?
LEONTES
How could that be? Have I done well?
Exit Gentleman

Good lady,
No court in Europe is too good for thee;
What dost thou then in prison?
Re-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler

Now, good sir,
You know me, do you not?
Is't lawful, pray you,
To see her women? any of them? Emilia?
Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA

Dear gentlewoman,
How fares our gracious lady?
PAULINA
A boy? Who's there?
First Servant
My lord?
LEONTES
How does the boy?
PAULINA
Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:
Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
Than the queen's life?
LEONTES
What noise there, ho?
LEONTES
What, canst not rule her?
Will you not push her out? Were I a tyrant,
Where were her life? What needs these hands?
My child?
LEONTES
I am a feather for each wind that blows:
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
And call me father? You, sir, come you hither;
You that have been so tenderly officious
With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,
So sure as this beard's grey,
--what will you adventure
To save this brat's life? Now, my liege,
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
That I should fear to die?
LEONTES
Hast thou read truth?
LEONTES
What is the business?
First Lord
What fit is this, good lady?
PAULINA
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
Must I receive, whose every word deserves
To taste of thy most worst?
Enter ANTIGONUS with a Child, and a Mariner
ANTIGONUS
Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
The deserts of Bohemia? Would any but
these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
hunt this weather? A boy or a child, I wonder?
Shepherd
What, art so near? What
ailest thou, man?
Shepherd
Why, boy, how is it?
Shepherd
Name of mercy, when was this, boy? What's within, boy?
Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my
son?
I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:
But shall I go mourn for that, my dear? what comes the wool to? Let me see; what am
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
this sister of mine do with rice? I must have saffron to colour the warden
pies; mace; dates?
Clown
What, by a horseman, or a footman? canst stand?
Clown
Dost lack any money?
Clown
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?
Clown
How do you now?
Clown
Shall I bring thee on the way?
How would he look, to see his work so noble
Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
The sternness of his presence?
POLIXENES
Wherefore, gentle maiden,
Do you neglect them?
FLORIZEL
What, like a corse? Here a dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses

POLIXENES
Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this
Which dances with your daughter? Has he any unbraided wares?
Clown
Is there no manners left among maids? will they
wear their plackets where they should bear their
faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are
going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all
our guests?
Clown
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
and lost all my money?
Clown
What hast here? ballads?
MOPSA
Is it true, think you? Why should I carry lies abroad?
DORCAS
Is it true too, think you?
DORCAS
Whither?
MOPSA
O, whither?
DORCAS
Whither?
DORCAS
What, neither?
MOPSA
Thou hast sworn it more to me:
Then whither goest? say, whither?
Follows singing

Will you buy any tape,
Or lace for your cape,
My dainty duck, my dear-a?
Any silk, any thread,
Any toys for your head,
Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
To CAMILLO

Is it not too far gone?
POLIXENES
What follows this?
POLIXENES
And this my neighbour too?
Shepherd
But, my daughter,
Say you the like to him?
POLIXENES
Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;
Have you a father?
FLORIZEL
I have: but what of him?
POLIXENES
Knows he of this? Pray you once more,
Is not your father grown incapable
Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
But what he did being childish? Will't please you, sir, be gone?
Exit

FLORIZEL
Why look you so upon me?
I think, Camillo?
CAMILLO
Sir, I think
You have heard of my poor services, i' the love
That I have borne your father?
FLORIZEL
How, Camillo,
May this, almost a miracle, be done?
CAMILLO
Have you thought on
A place whereto you'll go?
FLORIZEL
Worthy Camillo,
What colour for my visitation shall I
Hold up before him?
CAMILLO
Yea, say you so? Camillo,
Preserver of my father, now of me,
The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
CAMILLO
Who have we here? why shakest thou so?
AUTOLYCUS
Are you in earnest, sir?
Have you done there? whither are you bound?
Shepherd
Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir? Seest
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy
business, I am therefore no courtier?
AUTOLYCUS
What advocate hast thou to him?
AUTOLYCUS
The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
Wherefore that box?
Shepherd
Why, sir?
Clown
Think you so, sir? an't
like you, sir? But what
talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries
are to be smiled at, their offences being so
capital?
AUTOLYCUS
After I have done what I promised? Are you a party in this business? I am
courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means
to do the prince my master good; which who knows how
that may turn back to my advancement? What were more holy
Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
What holier than, for royalty's repair,
For present comfort and for future good,
To bless the bed of majesty again
With a sweet fellow to't? Besides, the gods
Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
For has not the divine Apollo said,
Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
That King Leontes shall not have an heir
Till his lost child be found?
No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
And better used, would make her sainted spirit
Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
And begin, 'Why to me?
PAULINA
Will you swear
Never to marry but by my free leave?
LEONTES
What with him? What train?
LEONTES
His princess, say you, with him? not women? And hath he too
Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,
At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
The adventure of her person?
LEONTES
Where the warlike Smalus,
That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
LEONTES
Where's Bohemia?
LEONTES
Who? Camillo?
LEONTES
You are married?
LEONTES
My lord,
Is this the daughter of a king?
Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman
AUTOLYCUS
Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?
The news, Rogero? How goes it now, sir? this news
which is called true is so like an old tale, that
the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
found his heir? Did you see
the meeting of the two kings?
Second Gentleman
What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried
hence the child?
First Gentleman
What became of his bark and his followers?
First Gentleman
Are they returned to the court? Shall we thither and with our company piece
the rejoicing?
First Gentleman
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
See you these clothes?
Clown
Thou wilt amend thy life?
Clown
Not swear it, now I am a gentleman?
Shepherd
How if it be false, son?
PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue

I like your silence, it the more shows off
Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,
Comes it not something near?
I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
For being more stone than it?
Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
What was he that did make it? See, my lord,
Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
Did verily bear blood? Still, methinks,
There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
Could ever yet cut breath? Shall I draw the curtain? Nay, present your hand:
When she was young you woo'd her; now in age
Is she become the suitor?
Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
Thy father's court?
